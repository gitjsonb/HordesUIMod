==Potential features==

-   Add whisper chat filter
-   Implement inventory sorting
-   Add cooldown on skills (leverage skill icon URL, have a map for each skill icon mapping to its respective cooldown)
-   Clicking names in party to add as friends
-   Rotate map canvas with your direction (may not be possible)
-   Tooltip on buffs to show name+basic effect [cant get level probably]
-   Track gold per hour, must keep inventory open though [make sure user is aware]
-   Ctrl clicking item in inventory when Merchant is open to paste item name into search field, and search
-   Add keybind for friends list (Need to create custom keybind UI, accessible from Settings, disallow using same keybinds as game)
-   Alt+right click item stats should work from other windows - character at least, but ideally stash and auction
-   Add ability to alt+right click (or something like that) item in merchant to whisper the seller
-   (MAYBE) Track your sales in auction (may need more planning) (though Merchant UI being replaced by dek at some point...)
-   (MAYBE) Improved healer party frames
-   (MAYBE) Add toggleable option to include chat messages to right of party frame
-   (MAYBE) Fame/time meter
-   (MAYBE) Heals per second meter

==Technical improvements==

-   Remove all reliance on svelte- classes, likely breaks with updates (Partially started: Added `getWindow` method to utils.game)

==Bugs==

-   Occasionally target health frame can't be dragged until a window is opened or other UI change occurs.
-   If any windows are dragged outside of the screen view, they become inaccessible. We should pop it back into view automatically if it's dragged too far (Temporarily rectified - can reset UI pos in Settings)
