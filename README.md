# Contributing

Thanks so much for wanting to contribute to the Hordes userscript mod! We've built this repo to make it easy to add your own mod code without having to touch any of the preexisting code.

This repo uses ESLint and Prettier to lint and automatically format your code.
They will be run on every commit. You can also install the Prettier plugin for VS Code to format on save.

Feel free to contribute new mods, though if they're complex, it's recommended to discuss your mod idea and technical approach with the repo owner, to increase the likelihood your mod change is accepted.

# Mod structure

This repo contains multiple different mods that are all bundled into a single userscript.
If you'd like to contribute to this repo by adding a new mod, it's important you understand how individual mods are structured.
We strongly appreciate you trying to keep your code as consistent as possible with our preexisting code and mods.

Inside of `src/mods`, we have one folder per mod. If your mod needs any custom styles, you can add a `styles.scss` file that will be compiled into CSS and built into the userscript.

_Basic CSS Rules:_
You should never create new CSS IDs, only classes.
If the class is never called/toggled via javascript, and is stylistic only, please prefix the class with `uimod-`.
If the class is called/toggled via javascript, please prefix the class with `js-`.

_Getting into the Javascript:_
Your mod folder will also contain an `index.js` file that _must_ export an object following the structure:

```js
{
	name: 'Your mod name',
	description: 'Brief description of your mod',
	run: () {
		callsToYourModFunctionHere();
	}
}
```

Functions in `index.js` should all be called from the `run` method. Any other methods your `index.js` file needs to call can be added to a `helpers.js` file.

If your mod needs to make changes (call functions) whenever part of the game changes, you can register these function calls inside of your run method as follows:

```js
run: ({ registerOnDomChange, registerOnChatChange, registerOnPageClick }): {
    // Whenever the game DOM changes
    // Technically: MutationObserver running whenever .layout changes
    registerOnDomChange(functionCallbackHere);

    // Whenever something in chat changes
    // Technically: Mutation observer running whenever #chat changes
    registerOnChatChange(functionCallbackHere);

    // Whenever user clicks anywhere on page
    // Technically: `click` Event listener running on document.body
    registerOnPageClick(functionCallbackHere);
}
```

When creating your mod, feel free to browse and use the various helper methods in `src/utils`. These utils contain helpful functions that are shared or are expected to be shared between multiple mods.

You will also need to update `src/mods/index.js`, adding your mod to the end of the exported array in this file. This ensures it is run.

# Other places contributors will need to touch

Increment `VERSION` in `src/version.js`.
Generally, bugfixes/small improvements to existing features should increment the third number `1.0.1`.
New features should increment the second number `1.1.1`.
Don't worry about incrementing the first number.

Finally, add yourself as an author - update `src/authors.js` and add your preferred name to the end of the array. It'll be included in the compiled userscript on all future versions.

# Building the userscript

If you've made custom modifications to this repo, you can run `npm run build` to build the userscript and test it locally by copypasting it into Tampermonkey.
